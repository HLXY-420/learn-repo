\section{What is PINNs}
\par Physicsâ€“Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a scientific machine learning technique used to solve problems involving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). It approximates the solution of PDEs by training a neural network to minimize a loss function and includes terms reflecting the initial and boundary conditions along the space-time domain's boundary and the PDE residual at collocation points, selected points in the domain.
\par PINNs' input is a point in integration domain and its output is an estimated solution in that point of a DE after training. And PINNs are unsupervised.
\par PINN is not the only NN framework utilized to solve PDEs, such as the Deep Ritz method, the Galerkin method or Petrov-Galerkin method, hp-VPINN, CPINN, PCNNS.
\par Advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item mesh-free
    \item enable on-demand solution computation after a training stage
    \item allow solutions to be made differentiable using analytical gradients
    \item solve forward jointly and inverse problems using the same optimization problem
\end{itemize}
